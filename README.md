# Implementation of Custom Memory Allocator
This repo contains custom implementation of malloc, free, realloc and calloc in C.
I'm using sbrk() underneath to get the heap allocation.


The main() contains an example program to use the custom memory allocator.
Modify the main() to test all four functions.
